###Instructions###

*This is a guide document to help you write the project proposal.*

*You have to remove this "Instructions" section and replace any text between brackets `[` and `]`.*

*NOTE: For readability, individual items in a list are not surrounded by brackets (with the exception of the section titled  "Deliverables and Milestones"). Assume these need also be replaced
Also, any other text is written as an example.*

*Post questions in the* ***public discussion forum*** *for the current project.*

*Note: As long as your proposal contains the key parts and descriptions you may format this document as you see fit. However, I highly recommend certain sections such as* "Objectives and Deliverables" *be described via a bulleted list.*

## 1.0	Project Overview
### 1.1 Abstract

[How would you briefly describe the purpose of your project?]

[Often readers lack sufficient time to read the entire project proposal. Therefore, a short synopsis is necessary to provide motivation and a high level introduction of the project. ]

* [Give a brief introduction as to ***problem statement***, the ***scope*** and a high level description of the system to be ***delivered***.] 
*	[Include ***background*** for the project. Motivate the project by describing:
  * What is the value of the system over the status quo?
  * How will the final product be used by the target customer?]


### 1.2.	Target Customer [important part]

[Who is the target audience?]

[List the intended user group(s):
*	Who is  client (direct customer)? 
*	Who is user (indrect customer)?]

For example, for a patient management software the client may be the dental office and users may be Office Manager, Patient Coordinator, and Receptionist.


### 1.3.	Search Words 
[Brief descriptors of your project that you think someone might use to search for your project. The descriptor may be three to five words or short phrases.]


###1.4.	Scope and Objectives [critical section]
[What is the scope and goals of your group project?]

[The scope describes the specific software system that your team will be designing and delivering.]

[Reminder:

*	The ideal project will be a software system that will challenge a team of 4 or 5 students to use a broad range of software engineering skills. This includes skills, such as, requirements analysis, software design and architecture,  implementation, testing, to project planning, scheduling, tracking and documentaiton.

*	Each student will each work approximately 10 hours per week for 4 weeks<sup>[1](#footnote_1)</sup>.  As part of the team experience, you will be analyzing what the client would be asking from the developers, list the services and features  to be provided by the proposed system, estimate the efforts for each service or feature, identify the components that have priority and negotiate project services based on time (and budget constraints).<br>
 *<sup><a name="footnote_1">1</a></sup>Note: Rarely does a proposal come in over the top. Instead, more often a proposal is not sufficient in scope and hence not accepted (until modified).*

*	 For every component, state whether you will be working on the implementation<sup>[2](#footnote_2)</sup> that  will support it, or whether you will use existing work. <br>
 *<sup><a name="footnote_2">2</a></sup>Note: The impelementation involves source code.*]

## 2.0	Team and Constraints

###2.1.	Team profile
[What are the strengths for each team member?]

[For each member of the team ***describe qualifications and strengths***<sup>[3](#footnote_3)</sup>.

*<sup><a name="footnote_3">3</a></sup>Note: Every team member is expected to be involved in all project activities. This section only describes individual strengths, and NOT the team member’s sole responsibilites.*]


### 2.1.	Challenges
[What are the challenges you foresee in successfully completing your project?]

[Provide a ***description of challenges*** that your group might face. These are often technical and non-technical aspects that may not be apparent to the reader.]

For example, if you were creating a software system for a dental office to manage patients, a challenge may be learning the domain, which involves following HIPPA regulations in disclosure of protected health information.

### 2.2.	Assumptions and Constraints
[Under what assumptions and constraints will the team adhere to?]

[**List any specific assumptions on which the project is based on and imposed constraints** that your team will be working under. Non-technical constraints could be: such as schedule and budget. Technical constraints may be design or implementation metholodogies, tools, operating system(s), hardware or software constraints.

* Non-Technical Constraints:
  * Such as time limit
  * add here...
* Techinical Constraints:
  * add here...]

##3.0	Deliverables and Milestones

### 3.1.	Project Deliverables 

[What are the specific delivarables by your team?]

[***Provide a list of deliverables***<sup>[4](#footnote_4)</sup> of any project artifacts.]

Deliverables include:
*	Software System Project Proposal.
*	[design document]
*	[user manual and installation instructions]
*	[presentations]
*	[any other documents]
*	[implementation code]
*	[This list may include product deployment activities that are necessary for the successful use of the system your team develops.]

 *<sup><a name="footnote_4">4</a></sup>Note: This list may be modified over the weeks until the final submission.* 



### 3.2.	Schedule and Budget Summary [critical section]
[What are the projected milestones and specific delivarables?]

[Fill in your teams projected milestones. You will be modifying this over the next few weeks.]
